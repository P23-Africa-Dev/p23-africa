### 👥 Admin & Staff Management

  - **Staff:** Limited dashboard based on permissions:
    - `manage_events` → Events management
    - `resource_hub` → Blog/resource management
    - `view_students` → View students
- **Staff CRUD**:
  - Admin can create staff with:
    - Name, email, autogenerated password.
    - Permission selection for dashboard access.
    - Automatic email notification with login details.
  - Admin can **suspend/reactivate staff**.
  - Admin can **promote staff to admin** with notification.
- Staff **activity logging** for transparency.

- Compatible with shared hosting using:

  - Optionally using a `/cron?token=SECRET` fallback route.

### 🔒 Access Control

- Uses `@can` Blade directives for permission-based block visibility.
